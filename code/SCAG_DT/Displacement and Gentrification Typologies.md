## Typologies

This repository is a continuation of the [Urban Displacement Replication Project](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/udp_replication_project_methodology_10.16.2020-converted.pdf). **These maps have not been groundtruthed to verify accuracy in accordance with UDP's methodology and therefore cannot be officially endorsed by the UDP.** However, because they are based on the original UDP code, they are largely reflective of past UDP results.  You can read the last report that UDP conducted with SPARCC [here](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/sites/default/files/udp_replication_project_methodology_10.16.2020-converted.pdf) to learn more about this projects methodology and typologies.

UDP's Displacement Typologies use housing and demographic data from the US Census, as well as real estate market data from Zillow to classify a metropolitan area's census tracts into eight distinct categories. Each category represents a stage of neighborhood change, although should not be taken to represent a linear trajectory or to predetermine neighborhood outcomes. Instead, typologies allow practitioners and researchers to see patterns in their regions over a specified time period, and are meant to start conversations about how policy interventions and investment could respond and support more equitable development.


It is important to note that in considering the entire metropolitan region, UDP's typologies classify both low- and middle-income neighborhoods at risk of or experiencing displacement or gentrification, as well as high-income neighborhoods where housing markets are becoming increasingly 'exclusive' to low income residents. UDP believes that classifying tracts in such a way allows practitioners to get a broader picture of neighborhood dynamics, specifically the concentration of poverty and wealth within a region.

UDP's Typologies have evolved over time in response to community and partner feedback and the availability of new data sources. This code represents the code's most recent iteration. It makes use of data from the 2013-2018 American Community Survey; 1990, 2010 and 2000 Decennial Census; and 2012-2017 Zillow Home Value and Rent Indices. Overlay data comes from a variety of sources, detailed in `code/README.md`.
